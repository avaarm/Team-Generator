## Description 

Team Generator is a command-line-interface (CLI) application that allows a user to create a team. The user will be allowed to input information about the team member such as title and employee ID. Once the user answers a series of questions about the employees an html file will be automatically generated. 

This project has helped me gain a better understanding of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism. I was also able to explore and gain better understanding of inquirer and testing with jest.
